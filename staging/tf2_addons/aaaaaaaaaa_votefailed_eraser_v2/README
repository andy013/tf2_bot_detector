This disables the CallVoteFailed element and the vote_failed.wav noise. Made for Pazer
as part of the TF2 Bot Detector project by ClusterConsultant and Moeb with <3.

This will reset all voting related UI elements to default. This is unavoidable as the
way TF2 loads custom requires that the entire file be present so one could not just
override the vote failed related parts. If you want your custom HUD to still apply
to the voting ui simply replace
`tf2_bot_detector/tf2_addons/aaaaaaaaa_votefailed_eraser_v2/resource/ui/botdetector_tf_hud_base/votehud.res`
with your `custom/exampleHUD/resource/ui/votehud.res` file.
